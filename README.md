# Cheltenham Festivals Calendar Scraper

Add Cheltenham Festivals' events to your Google Calendar.

Cheltenham Festivals offer exciting events such as the Jazz Festival, the Music
Festival, and, my personal favourite, the Science Festival. While this project,
works for all three of these festivals, it is particularly useful for the
latter.

The Science Festival is a yearly almost a week-long celebration of popular
science. The festival offers more than a hundred interesting talks and other
engaging activities in a variety of subjects. That is a lot to choose from and
add to your calendar. This Python project helps with both of these tasks:

- Scrape the details of all events from the selected festival and save them in a
  CSV file to see the descriptions, dates, days of the week, times, and
  locations at a glance.
- Create Google Calendar links to easily add your selected events to your
  calendar.
