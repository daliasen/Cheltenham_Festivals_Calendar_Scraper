# Cheltenham Festivals Calendar Scraper

Add Cheltenham Festivals' events to your Google Calendar.

Cheltenham Festivals other exciting events such as Jazz, Music, and my personal
favourite, Science Festival. While this project, works for all three of these
festivals, it is particularly useful for the latter.

Science Festival is a yearly almost a week-long celebration of popular science.
The festival offers more than a hundred of interesting talks and other engaging
activities in a variety of subjects. That is a lot to choose from and add to
your calendar. This Python project helps with both of these tasks:

- Scrape the details of all events from the selected festival and save them in a CSV file to see the description, dates, and times at a glance.
- Create Google Calendar links to easily add your selected events to your calendar.
